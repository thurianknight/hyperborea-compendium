## Introduction

If you're a game master who uses Foundry VTT, the **Hyperborea Compendium** provides the content module you can use with the [Hyperborea system for Foundry VTT](https://github.com/thurianknight/hyperborea). It includes all the class descriptions, equipment lists, spells, monsters, treasure types and magic items from the *Hyperborea Player's Manual* and *Hyperborea Referee's Manual*.

While the Hyperborea Compendium provides much of the information from the published game, you will still require the complete *Hyperborea* role-playing game ruleset to actually play. Find the game at the [North Wind Adventures](https://www.hyperborea.tv) website, [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4453/North-Wind-Adventures), or your favorite game reseller.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Content**: Hyperborea Compendium offers a wide range of information covering various aspects of the Hyperborea game, including character classes, spells, equipment, monsters, treasure types, and magic items.
- **Familiar Organization**: The compendium is organized into sections that are similar to the printed books. This makes it easy to find information on a given topic, even if you do not also own the books (but we do recommend any players acquire the *Hyperborea Player's Manual*, and game masters should get both the *Hyperborea Player's Manual* and *Hyperborea Referee's Manual*).
- **Collaborative Platform**: Users can contribute to the project by adding new compendium articles, updating existing ones, or suggesting improvements. This collaborative approach ensures that the compendium continues to grow and evolve over time.
- **Customization Options**: Hyperborea Compendium allows users to customize their experience by creating personalized collections, bookmarks, and notes. This feature is particularly useful for writers and game masters who want to organize their own campaigns or stories within the Hyperborea setting.
