It moves about on its long rear legs and has short grasping arms in front, ending with sharp claws. The carnivorous c&oelig;lurus hunts in packs, which act similarly to flocks of birds. C&oelig;lurus have camouflaged skin colouring, which makes them excellent ambushers. The snake-men tame c&oelig;lurus and use them as humans use dogs.

Ape-men communicate via a limited vocabulary of grunts, growls, hoots, and trills. Brutish and violent, ape-men are omnivorous, though preferring raw meat. Their warriors and hunters wear the hides of beasts; some don human armour when opportunity presents. Weapons include clubs, slings, and hand-hurled stones, unless the ape-men acquire steel.</p>\n<p>Ape-man tribes dwell in caves, mountains, and forests. About 1 in 12 is an ape-man alpha, a physically dominant humanoid.

The abdomen is perpendicular to the head, vertically oriented like a humanoid torso, with exoskeletal arms extending from shoulder joints; the arms terminate in great claws capable of rending flesh and bone. Four exoskeletal legs project from the bottom of the abdomen, each treble-jointed and tapering to points on which the creatures balance themselves and ambulate sideways. Crab-man overlords are physically dominating examples that naturally assume positions of leadership in the crab-man hierarchy.

They stand upright and average seven feet tall, two feet of which comprise their long, featherless necks; however, because their necks droop, their full height scarcely is realized. Bird-men have long, scaly legs that end in three-toed talons, narrow upper bodies feathered in black, and powerful wings that span eight or more feet. Their wings are plumed in black, white, and brown (females) or red (males).</p>\n<p>This race of semi-intelligent, humanoid birds rarely lives in autonomy; primarily, they exist in servility to other intelligent beings. This arrangement suits them so long as they are sheltered and fed (grains and small lizards, fish, or amphibians). Typically, a small flock (including mated pairs) serve a master. Solitary bird-men oft refuse to eat and will die of starvation, unable to carry on without the companionship of the flock.</p>\n<p>Bird-men are notorious for both their cowardice and their incessant garrulity, for they speak the Common tongue of mankind. They can be obstinate (oft refusing to complete tasks), lazy, argumentative, and insulting (especially to one another), but when motivated they can be trained to fly collectively a basket of cargo that weighs no more than 200 pounds per bird-man. They almost always flee violence; however, the threat of violence from their masters rarely inspires them to cooperation. Almost nothing can convince them to fly over the ocean.
