When a druid gains enough <em>experience points</em> (XP) to reach 9th level, he or she must seek out and challenge one who has already achieved that rank (unless a vacancy exists). A challenge is met at a sacred grove or henge during an astronomical or astrological event of significance, when members of the sect assemble.</p>\n<p>The druidic challenge can be one of matched weapons and/or of sorcery; in any case, rites are performed that bring to witness a deity such as Lunaqqua, Thaumagorga, or Yoon&rsquo;Deh (or an agent thereof). The duel is not necessarily to the death, but loss of life is possible. A defeated but still living druid is reduced in experience to one experience point short of 9th level (255,999 XP) and must abide one year of waiting before issuing a new challenge or rematch. A victorious challenger is promoted to 9th level, awarded the appropriate abilities.
