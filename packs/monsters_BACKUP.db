Culturally they range from utter primitivism (fire and stone tool use) to mock sophistication and reason rivalling the lowliest of mankind. Ape-men communicate via a limited vocabulary of grunts, growls, hoots, and trills. Brutish and violent, ape-men are omnivorous, though preferring raw meat. Their warriors and hunters wear the hides of beasts; some don human armour when opportunity presents. Weapons include clubs, slings, and hand-hurled stones, unless the ape-men acquire steel.</p>\n<p>Ape-man tribes dwell in caves, mountains, and forests. About 1 in 12 is an ape-man alpha, a physically dominant humanoid. Also, most tribes of 20 or more indi- viduals will have a shaman; these sorcerers typically hallow Yug or Xathoqqua.</p>\n<p>N.B.: An advanced group of some 5,000 ape-men populates the City-State of Kor and serves as its ruling elite.

Ape-men communicate via a limited vocabulary of grunts, growls, hoots, and trills. Brutish and violent, ape-men are omnivorous, though preferring raw meat.

Weapons include clubs, slings, and hand-hurled stones, unless the ape-men acquire steel.</p>\n<p>Ape-man tribes dwell in caves, mountains, and forests. About 1 in 12 is an ape-man alpha, a physically dominant humanoid.
