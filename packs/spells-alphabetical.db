One can set aflame the wooden tower of a <strong>vampire</strong> and not break the spell, even if the undead beast burns, but if one throws a <em>fireball</em> at the same vampire, that is direct harm.

Shoot the same beast with a heavy crossbow? <em>Invisibility</em> breaks. <em>Sleep</em> spell causes no harm and typically involves no saving throw, so it will not break <em>invisibility</em>.
